# WEDGE Decentralized Chat Application
This is our submission for our 322 project. This is a decentralized chat application loosely based on the work done by Fireship. https://github.com/fireship-io/gun-chat Most of the Svelte components were built from the ground up, and we improved on the messaging components from Fireship. We used Gun.JS, Svelte, Bootstrap, and NodeJS to complete this project.
